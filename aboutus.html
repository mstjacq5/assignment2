    <h2><em>About Us</em></h2>
    <p>Here at <strong>Dirty D's Salt Water Emporium</strong>, the hobbyist's go to for their aquarium needs, we strive to provide the best service possible. Our mission is to make the aquarium hobby into a self sustaining enterprise. The dark mark on keeping saltwater aquariums is the global farming of natural reefs. We strive to crack the code on fish breeding and coral propagation.</p>
   <p>Our main goals include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Preserving the wild reef</li>
    <li>Uncovering the secrets behind breeding fish in captivity</li>
        <li>Creating the natural environment in the home aquarium</li>
    <li>Propegating rare corals to revive populations</li></ul>
    <p>Many fish are caught wild due to limitations in the captive breeding realm. We plan to use our extensive hatchery to crack the code on each species captive breeding needs. From the discovery that flower pots encourage breeding with clown fish to what ever discoveries we make, we hope to provide a comprehensive list of aquarium fish that are sustainable. </p>
    <p>Lately, governments have been cutting of sources of coral due to the massive die outs of the coral reefs. <strong>Whether you believe it or not, global warming and greenhouse gas emmissions have been on the rise due to humanities distinct disregard for the outcome of their actions</strong>. Due to this increase in greenhouse gasses, the temperature and pH of the ocean has been on the rise. Coral gets most of its nutrients from photosynthetic bacteria that live inside of the coral. Sure corals have mouths and can eat fleshy, meaty bits that float around the ocean, but that is not their main source of food. If the bacteria inside of the coral dies due to the conditions of the ocean, then the coral ends up as what is commonly known as <strong>coral bleaching</strong>. This turns the coral a pale white color, and often results in coral death. We may be at the point of no return, in terms of saving ocean life, but the idea is that if we reduce what we take for our hobby, we make an example for the world. The example is that <em>if hobbyists are willing to change how they view the reef, why can't your average Joe</em>.</p>
